# Getting to the core: Install .NET CORE

<div class="aside">
<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Download the <em>.NET SDK</em> and run the Installer.</li>
  <li> run the <em>dotnet</em> command.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Before you investigate the incident, you must install the latest version of the .NET SDK to understand the dotnet bots. You can get the .NET SDK from <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download">here</a>.


## Verify Installation

When the installer completes, open a new command prompt or terminal window and run the ```dotnet``` command. This will verify .NET is correctly installed and ready to use.

```cmd
C:\Users\Billy> dotnet
```
If you're not sure how to install .NET or how to make sure its installed, read the "Help" section of this challenge

After you run the <code>dotnet</code> command ,type the second listed option in the text field on the right and press the _HACK_ button.
