# Example Objective

<div class="aside">
<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It's good to keep high level tasks here.</li>
  <li>Let players know when to click <em>HACK</em>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Give players a little bit of information about what they need to do to hack past this objective. If you find yourself writing more than a few short paragraphs of text, it's likely your objective is too big!

## You can make sub headers with more information

Some times you wan to talk about additional concepts beyond the high level goal that might help players accomplish the high level goal.

```js
const areCodeSamplesVeryHelpful = true;
```

Describe the final values for your player one last time. Then ask them to click the _HACK_ button.
