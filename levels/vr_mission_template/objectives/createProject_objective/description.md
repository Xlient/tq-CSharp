The activities from here on will require that you create a C# project on your computer.
To do this first create a folder to hold your project. Once you have created a folder, you can do one of the following to create your project:

1. Inside the new folder you made, type in:
  <code>dotnet new console  -n name of your project </code> in your terminal

Here is an example.
```cmd
C:\Users\Billy\MyNewFolder> dotnet new console -n myapp
C:\Users\Billy\MyNewFolder> cd myapp
C:\Users\Billy\MyNewFolder\myapp> 
```


2. If you have Visual Studio IDE installed open it up and create a new project in the folder you just made

Once you have done so, enter <strong>the full path to your project folder</strong> and <strong>the full path to your Program.cs file in your
project folder</strong>
in the text field on the right and click the _HACK_ button.
