The activities from here on will require you to create a C# project on your computer via the dotnet Command line interface (CLI) or Visual Studio

To do this first open your terminal and create a folder to hold your project. Once you have created a folder, you can do one of the following to create your project:

1. Navigate to the folder you just created and inside the new folder you made, type in the following command:
  <code>dotnet new console  -n <name of your project> </code> in your terminal

Here is an example.
```cmd
C:\Users\Billy\MyNewFolder> dotnet new console -n myapp
C:\Users\Billy\MyNewFolder> cd myapp
C:\Users\Billy\MyNewFolder\myapp> 
```


2. If you have Visual Studio IDE installed, create a new project in the folder you just made.
See the "Help" tab for more instructions

Once you have done so, enter <strong>the full path to your project folder</strong> and <strong>the full path to your Program.cs file in your project folder</strong> in the text field on the right and click the _HACK_ button.
