# The "Help" Tab

We may remove this tab and content in the future, but in the current iteration of TwilioQuest, this is where you would put more hand-holdy content intended to guide the player through what needed to be done.

We find that what works better is linking to external resources on the web, rather than recreatign a tutorial here.
