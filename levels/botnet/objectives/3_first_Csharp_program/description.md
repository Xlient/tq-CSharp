# Your first C# program

<div class="aside">
<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Open your project in an editor</li>
  <li> Modify your code to print "Hello Cloud!" </li>
</ul>
</div>

We're making great progress, lets proceed by taking a look at our project we just made.
Navigate to your project folder and open up it up in the code editor of choice.
Open your <code>program.cs <code> file

when you ran
```cmd
dotnet new console -n myapp
```

A new console application was made for you with some code to get you started. It's a simple program that prints the message "Hello World!" to your console. See the Help section to learn more about the " Hello world application". 
It used the  <code>Console.WriteLine()</code> method to print that message. 
## Your task

Modify the <code>Console.WriteLine()</code> method to print "Hello Cloud!"
```cs

Console.WriteLine("Hello Cloud!");
```

When your done modifying your code click the _HACK_ button.
