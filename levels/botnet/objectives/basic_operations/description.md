<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Convert the given value into an Integer </li>
  <li> Calculate the Pin Code based on the formula then click <em>HACK</em>.</li>

 You can also perform mathematical operations like addition , subtraction  and etc with variables.

```cs
int x = 7;
int y = 4;
int z = x + y; // 11
```
  In addition to these are the <code> Increment ++, Decrement -- and Remainder %</code> operations.

|    Operator |    Symbol     |                       Example       Int num = 10                   |
| ----------- | -----------   | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Increment   |    ++         |  Increases the value ts operand by 1    e.g num++                  |
| Decrement   |    --         |  Decreases the value of its operand by 1   e.g num--               |
| Remainder   |    %          | Computes the remainder after preforming division   num  %   4  = 2 |
## Calculate the PIN

Using C# Operators you can calculate and print out the correct 4 digit pin code to unlock the laser barrier.
Here is the formula <code> pin = (144000 % 866) * (4 + 3)  </code>

Once you're done  be sure to click the _HACK_ button.
